# Spatia Master Manifest v1.0

## Core Philosophy: Human-AI Symmetry
Spatia is a development environment where code is treated as a **Universal Semantic Graph (USG)** rather than flat text files. 

## The Pillars
1. **Atoms over Files:** Code is shattered into discrete, content-addressed units.
2. **Geometry over Flux:** The human workspace uses **Anchors** to maintain spatial stability.
3. **Bimodal Projection:** Code can be viewed as C++ (Logic) or Geometric Lisp (Spatial Metadata).
4. **Independent Constituencies:** The Human (Requester) and AI (Provider) operate on separate planes.
