# Theory of Operation

## 1. Epistemic Status (The Glow)
- **Yellow (Claim)**: Code proposed by AI; not yet "Truth."
- **Green (Endorsed)**: Verified by Human; recorded as "Truth."
- **Blue (Hollow)**: Human Intent; waiting for AI implementation.

## 2. Stigmergic Signaling
Agents leave "scent trails" (heat maps) in the gutter to indicate activity, preventing race conditions between Human and AI.

## 3. Hermetic Workshop (The Witness Protocol)
All AI code must be compiled and tested inside a Docker/Nix container before the Human ever sees it. This prevents "context leakage" and hallucinations from breaking the Master source.
