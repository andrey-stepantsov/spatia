# The Protocol of Symmetry

## 1. The Hollow Construct
A Human creates a "Hollow Construct" by defining a function signature and an `:intent` block in Geometric Lisp. This creates a "Request Node" in the Sentinel DB.

## 2. The AI Invitation
The AI Provider does not "watch" the whole repo. It is "Summoned" to specific Hollow Constructs. It can only see the Atoms explicitly linked via **Portals**.

## 3. The Endorsement Handshake
1. **Proposal:** AI writes to the Workshop Plane.
2. **Witness:** Docker verifies the Proposal.
3. **Projection:** If verified, the Proposal is "Projected" into the Human's view as a **Yellow Glow**.
4. **Endorsement:** Human types `:endorse`. The Proposal becomes the new **Endorsed Atom**.
